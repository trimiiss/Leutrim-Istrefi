        <p>
          Products shown in our online shop can be ordered by adding them to the
          shopping cart. You can change the selected items at any time before
          completing the order using the buttons in the shopping cart. The Back
          button in your browser will take you back to the previous step in the
          order process. By clicking ''Submit & pay'' you accept our offer to
          conclude a binding contract for the products selected. We will then
          immediately send you an email confirming your order has been received.
          We do not save the text of the contract after the contract has been
          concluded, meaning it cannot be accessed by the customer. You can
          archive the order data and GTC by saving or printing out the order
          summary in the last step of your order. The contract can be concluded
          in the following languages: German and English.

          the European Union. These are payable by you to foreign authorities.
          For additional information, please contact the respective authorities
          in the country of delivery. You will find more information about our

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <span>4.Prices and payment</span>
        <p>
          All prices are final prices and include statutory value added tax. The
          price and any shipping charges are indicated in a summary page before
          the order is submitted. We offer the following methods of payment for
          orders placed through our online shop: Credit card, PayPal, Klarna
          (instant transfer), Apple Pay, and Amazon Pay. We charge no additional
          fees based on the payment method.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <span>5.Additional information</span>
        <p>
          All orders are subject to a statutory warranty for defects. For
          material defects and defects of title we are liable according to the
          provisions of the law notwithstanding any warranties extended by us.
          Information on warranties and warranty terms can be found on the
          respective product page. The goods remain our property until the
          purchase price has been paid in full. Consumers are entitled to a
          statutory right to rescind when concluding distance contracts.
          Information on your right to rescind and the cost of returns can be
          found on the following page: Here
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span>6.Liability </span>
        <p>
          Claims for compensation are excluded. This does not include claims for
          violation to life, body or health, under warranties, or under the
          product liability act, and liability for other damages due to wilful
          or grossly negligent breach of duty. Furthermore, liability for breach
          of obligations the fulfilment of which enables the proper execution of
          the contract in the first place and upon the adherence to which you
          routinely rely remains unaffected. In the case of slightly negligent
          breach of these contractual obligations we are only liable for the
          foreseeable damages typical for the contract. The aforementioned
          limitations of liability also apply to our legal representatives and
          agents.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <span>7.Final provisions        </span>
        <p>The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Mandatory provisions of the country of your habitual residence remain unaffected by the aforementioned choice of law. If you are a merchant, corporate body under public law or public separate estate with registered office in Germany at the time the order is placed, the exclusive place of jurisdiction is Düsseldorf.
